This group assignment was for the 4th semester course on Problem Solving with C. Our task was to implement cryptography in a topic of our choice and then prototype it on ESP32. We decided to encrypt and decrypt DNA sequences and used MQTT for implementation on ESP32. These mechanisms were implemented using the Romulus algorithm.
